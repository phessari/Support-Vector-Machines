# Support-Vector-Machines
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful and widely used learning algorithm. Using the regression algorithm, we minimized misclassification errors. However, in SVMs, our optimization objective is to maximize the margin. The margin is defined as the distance between the separating hyperplane (decision boundary) and the training samples that are closest to this hyperplane, which are the so-called support vectors.  SVMs classify data by finding the hyper plane that maximaze the margin between the classes in the training data.
